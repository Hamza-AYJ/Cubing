<h4>What did I learn about algorithms?</h4>
  I learned that algorithms are a set of processes that are used to achieve a certain goal. In terms of rubiks cubes and this class, 
  algorithms are tools and processes we use in orer to reach certain points and checkpoints while trying to solve the rubiks cube. Once
  you have reached that state on the rubiks cube we can then proceed to use the next algorithm in order to achieve the next state. Algoriths
  can work in ways that are unique to the systems they are being used, and can be used appropriatly
  
<h4>How do I know it was algorrithmic?</h4>
  If you are able to repeat this algorirthm and acheive the same result every time, then it is an algoritm. If the algoritm can be repeated
  tested, and used everytime and achieve the same end result then it is an algorithm.
  
<h4>What is an algorithm to you?</h4>
  An Algortihm to me is a set of rules and patterns used to accomplish a certain task or reach a certain goal. An algoritm is reliable,
  can change according to need, and works reglardless of the situation. There can be different algi
